## The Problem

You just spent 45 minutes in a deep conversation with ChatGPT. You found the perfect architecture for your project. Now you need to share it with Claude for implementation.

What do you do?

**Ctrl+A, Ctrl+C?** You get a mess of HTML artifacts, broken formatting, and missing code blocks.

**Copy each message manually?** Life is too short.

**Screenshot it?** Text in images is where knowledge goes to die.

AI conversations are the new unit of knowledge work. But moving them between tools feels like faxing a PDF in 2026.

**CtxPort fixes this.** One click, and your entire conversation becomes a clean, structured Markdown document -- ready to paste into any AI tool, editor, or knowledge base.

### The Difference

|                              | Without CtxPort                                    | With CtxPort                         |
| :--------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------- | :----------------------------------- |
| **Copy a conversation**      | Select all, copy, paste, fix formatting for 10 min | One click. Done.                     |
| **Move context between AIs** | Re-type your whole conversation history            | Paste the Context Bundle, keep going |
| **Save a conversation**      | Bookmark it and pray the URL survives              | Structured Markdown you own forever  |
| **Share with your team**     | "Let me screenshot this..."                        | Share a clean `.md` file             |
| **Extract just the code**    | Scroll through 50 messages hunting for snippets    | Code Only mode, one click            |

### Key Benefits

```
  No account required           Works offline
  Zero data uploaded            100% local processing
  Minimal permissions           Open source (MIT)
```

```

1. **Browse** any supported platform
2. **Click** the CtxPort copy button (or press `Alt+Shift+C`)
3. **Paste** your structured Context Bundle anywhere

That's it. No configuration. No sign-up. No cloud.

## Features

### Copy From Anywhere

| Feature                 | Description                                                                        |
| :---------------------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **In-Chat Copy Button** | A copy button appears right in the conversation -- click to copy the entire thread |
| **Sidebar List Copy**   | Hover over any conversation in the sidebar and copy without even opening it        |
| **Keyboard Shortcut**   | `Alt+Shift+C` copies the current conversation instantly                            |
| **Multiple Formats**    | Full, User Only, Code Only, Compact -- pick what you need                          |

### Sidebar List Copy -- The Feature Nobody Else Has

Most copy tools make you open a conversation first. CtxPort lets you hover over conversations in the sidebar and copy them directly. Need to grab 5 conversations for a project brief? Hover, click, hover, click. No page loads. No waiting.

### Context Bundle Format

Every copy produces a structured Markdown document with frontmatter metadata:

```markdown
---
ctxport: v2
source: chatgpt
url: https://chatgpt.com/c/abc123
title: "Discuss REST API Authentication"
date: 2026-02-07T14:30:00Z
nodes: 24
format: full
---

## User

I'm building a SaaS product and need to choose between
API key auth and OAuth2. What do you recommend?

## Assistant

Based on your scenario, I'd recommend a layered approach...
```

The frontmatter tells any receiving tool exactly where this conversation came from, when it happened, and how many messages it contains. Structured context, not just raw text.

### Copy Formats

| Format        | What You Get                             | Best For                               |
| :------------ | :--------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------- |
| **Full**      | Complete conversation with all messages  | Context transfer between AI tools      |
| **User Only** | Only your messages (prompts)             | Reusing your prompts in a different AI |
| **Code Only** | Extracted code blocks with language tags | Grabbing implementation snippets       |
| **Compact**   | Condensed single-paragraph messages      | Quick sharing in chat or email         |

## Architecture

```
ctxport/
  packages/
    core-schema/       # Zod schemas for Context Bundle format
    core-plugins/      # Platform adapters (ChatGPT, Claude, etc.)
    core-markdown/     # Markdown serialization engine
    shared-ui/         # Shared React components
  apps/
    browser-extension/ # WXT + React 19 + Tailwind CSS 4
```

Built as a monorepo with pnpm workspaces and Turborepo. Each platform adapter is a self-contained plugin, making it straightforward to add new platforms.
